# Inception-of-Things (IoT)

A System Administration exercise designed to teach Kubernetes deployment and management through hands-on practice.

## What is this?

This project is a comprehensive learning exercise that introduces students to modern container orchestration and deployment practices. It covers the complete journey from basic Kubernetes setup to advanced GitOps workflows.

## Purpose

The project aims to provide practical experience with:
- **Container orchestration** using Kubernetes
- **Infrastructure as Code** principles
- **Continuous deployment** methodologies
- **Service mesh** and networking concepts
- **DevOps** best practices

## Structure

The project is divided into three progressive parts:

- **Part 1**: Foundation - Setting up Kubernetes clusters with K3s and Vagrant
- **Part 2**: Applications - Deploying multi-service applications with Ingress
- **Part 3**: GitOps - Implementing continuous deployment with K3D and ArgoCD

## Technologies Covered

- **Kubernetes** (K3s/K3D) - Container orchestration
- **ArgoCD** - GitOps continuous deployment
- **Docker** - Containerization
- **Vagrant** - Virtual machine management
- **Git** - Version control and deployment automation

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion, students will understand:
- How to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters
- Application deployment strategies
- GitOps workflows and continuous deployment
- Container networking and service discovery
- Infrastructure automation techniques

## Target Audience

System Administration students and professionals looking to gain practical Kubernetes experience in a structured learning environment.
